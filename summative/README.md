# Startup Success Prediction

## Mission
My mission is to empower aspiring entrepreneurs with data-driven insights that enhance decision-making and increase the chances of startup success. 
Many startups fail due to a lack of access to predictive tools that assess potential risks and success factors early in their journey.
